# Airline Reservation System

This repository contains the scaffolding for a multi-tier Airline Reservation System implemented with C# WinForms and ASP.NET MVC, using Entity Framework for data access and integration with external flight information APIs. The structure is organized to support separation of concerns between desktop, web, and service layers.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` – Application source code organized by project (domain, application services, infrastructure, UI layers, and APIs).
- `tests/` – Unit and integration test projects.
- `docs/` – Solution design, architecture references, and database documentation.

Refer to `docs/architecture/solution-structure.md` for a detailed description of each project.
